# inputlatency
Input latency testing for MiSTer FPGA
-I made a smal PCB with JST-PH connector for the controller button, mini USB from the User IO port, and the Arduino Pro Micro.
-I honestly don't remember what the full size USB connector was meant for so... ignore it.
-Be careful of the Pro Micro's micro USB port - most are very fragile / cheap.
