# Input latency testing for MiSTer FPGA
* I made a small PCB with JST-PH connector for the controller button, mini USB from the User IO port, and the Arduino Pro Micro.
** Use a JST-PH pigtail like this to solder to your controller button: https://amzn.to/3qjYl96
* The full-size USB labeled "Display" is meant for future display latency testing, should such a core be created.
* Be careful of the Pro Micro's micro USB port - most are very fragile / cheap.
