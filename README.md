# Input latency testing for MiSTer FPGA
* I made a small PCB with JST-PH connector for the controller button, mini USB from the User IO port, and the Arduino Pro Micro.
** Use a JST-PH pigtail like this to solder to your controller button: https://amzn.to/3qjYl96
* I honestly don't remember what the full size USB connector was meant for so... ignore it.
* Be careful of the Pro Micro's micro USB port - most are very fragile / cheap.
